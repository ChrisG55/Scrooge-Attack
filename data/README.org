This directory contains the raw data recorded during the measurements.

* guardband
Contains temperature dependent dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) measurements.
The raw data is organized in an hierarchical directory structure:

- ~<device>~: name of the device used for the measurement
- ~f<frequency>~: ARM CPU frequency of measurement in MHz
- ~dU<voltage>~: ARM CPU voltage adjustment in mV
- ~T<temperature>~: temperature at the start of the measurement in °C
- ~SL<temperature>~: soft limit temperature in °C (model 3B+ only)
- ~failures~: measurements that could not be started or that failed
- ~errors~: in case of a measurement error (/e.g./, power consumption not measured or system clock not synchronized with NTP)

The measurement results can be found in the ~T<temperature>~ directory unless there was a failure, in which case the results are found in the corresponding ~failures~ subdirectory.
The results are composed of the following log files:

- ~benchmark_*.log~: benchmark log
- ~benchmark_*.csv~: benchmark recorded values during measurement
- ~kernel_*.log~: crash failure (only for failed measurements, /e.g./, freeze during reboot or kernel panic)
- ~l2ping_*.log~: 32 pings are sent to measure the Bluetooth round trip time (RTT)
- ~powerspy_*.log~: PowerSpy stream log

* stability
